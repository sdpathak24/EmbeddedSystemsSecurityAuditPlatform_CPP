# Embedded Systems Security Audit Platform (C++)

A C++ framework for vulnerability scanning and protocol validation in embedded systems.

## Features

- CAN bus authentication & cryptographic logic implemented in modular C++ code.
- Automated report generation and logging of audit findings.
- Designed for desktop environments and ready for embedded ARM system compilation and deployment.

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Compile the Project

Open a terminal, change directory to the `src/` folder of the project:

Compile the source files using `g++`:

What happens next:

- The program simulates CAN bus message authentication.
- Performs a simple encryption of the CAN message.
- Writes the results of this audit to `scan_report.txt` inside the `src/` directory.
- Prints a confirmation message on the terminal indicating scan completion.

### 3. View the Output Report

To view the report generated by the program:

You should expect output similar to:
CAN Message Authentication FAILED
Encrypted message output:
18 62 4a 1c 7b f 5c 22
